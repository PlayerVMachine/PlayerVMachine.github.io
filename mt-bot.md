<h5 style="color:#D34043">Notes and Reminders</h5>

Set reminders for yourself that you can view and cancel at anytime.

Make notes for yourself from anywhere Media Central can read messages and it will h5in your notes in your DM chat with the bot. You can then refer to h5ins to see your notes or use the list command. You can also delete notes by unh5inning the message or using the unnote command.

I have a few things in mind that I'm working on but I'd love to hear from you if you have any suggestions!
