#### Get all the info you can from Steam

Start by getting an API key from [https://steamcommunity.com/dev](https://steamcommunity.com/dev), then you can drop in my [steam-api-wrapper](
https://github.com/PlayerVMachine/Simple-Steam-API-Wrapper) to your project, `npm install axios` \(used to make requests to the Steam API\) and you're all set to get JSON data back from all the endpoints [listed here](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API#GetNewsForApp_.28v0001.29).

The 'Read Me' for this wrapper on github also lists all the inputs and outputs available. Be sure to let me know if you run into any issues using the wrapper!
